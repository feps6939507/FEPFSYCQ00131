  <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <section id="Abstract">

          Moddeling stock prices is a difficult task. The normal distribution is often used as an easy way to model how stock prices change over time. It
          assumes thatreturns move around an average value in a fairly even and predictable pattern. This makes it straightforward to estimate volatility 
          and to work out how likely different price movements are. The approach has been important in the early development of financial models and 
          risk-management tools. However, real markets do not always behave insuch a tidy way eg. the finacial crisis of 2008 and the DotCom bubble of 2000,
          where stock prices had a heavy decline. Stock returns can show sudden jumps and more extreme changes than the normal distribution allows 
          for. Even so, it is still a useful starting point and a easy to understand simple benchmark for comparing more realistic models.

          One way to model a stock price and predict it's future movements is by using the normal distribution. It is a theoretical pattern that shows how values 
          in a population are spread out. It's often called the bell curve because of its bell curved shape. When stock prices follow a normal pattern, most prices
          cluster around the mean, which is the highest point of the curve or the turning point of the graph. The normal distribution also uses standard deviation.
          A measure that shows how much values are spread out from the mean. A small standard deviation means the prices stay close to the average. Whilst a large 
          standard deviation means the prices stay far away from the average. The area underneath the graph represents probability, so we can estime the 
          likelyhood of a stock price to fall in a certain range. We can also calculate outliers by finding a lower fence. Doing two standard deviations left of
          the mean. To calculate the upper fence we do two standard deviations right of the mean.

          One way we can model a stock price and predict the future price of a stock is by using the normal distribution. Firsty, what is the normal distribution?
          The normal distribution is a theoretical distribution of values of a population. Often reffered as the bell curve when plotted on a graph, data with a
          normal distribution (in this case it will be the stock price) tends to accumalate around the mean. Another tool that the normal distribution uses is the
          standard deviation. As shown below in the image standard deviation is detonated By (S). It is calculated by the sum of (Value of the ith point in the data
          set minus The mean value of the data set) from a start point i to an end point n divided by the population n-1. All square rooted. As shown in the yellow 
          image below the peak of the graph is the mean. The area underneath the graph is the probability eg. whats the probability that a companies share price will
          be in the range mean  to minus one standard deivation. if it was 30% for example because one of the properties of the normal distributions is it's 
          symetrical around the mean the range from the mean + one standard deviation will also be 30%. Lastly, we can calculate what stock prices are outliers eg.
          prices that dont fit the data or extreme cases. It is caculated by any prices that fall below minus two standard deviations left from the mean and any
          prices that fall above two standrad diveations right of the mean.

          In the image below I have made a Normal distribution for Nvidia's share price (The largest tech company in the world) For October 2025). As you can see in 
          the image we can estimate the mean roughly by taking the turning point of the normal distribution graph we can see its around a price of $188. For this 
          Model I created in excel the standard deviation was calculated to be 4.8 but we will use  a standard deviation of 5 for simplicity. So let's calculate 
          the potential future outliers for next month for Nvidia's using the previous data from October 2025. Firstly, calculate the lower end outlier by doing 
          188(mean) - 2x5(standard deviation) = 178 dollars meaning any price below is an outlier. To calculate the upper outlier we use 
          188(mean) + 2x5(standard deviation) = 198 dollars meaning any price above is an outlier.
      </p>
      <p>
         Futhermore, to what extent is the normal distribution effective to model and predict future stock prices? Firstly, Using the normal distribution to model and
         predict future stock prices has several strengths, but it also comes with limitations. One advantage is its simplicity. The normal distribution is 
         easy to work with, and many statistical tools are built around it, making calculations for expected returns, volatility (How fast prices change in the market), and risk more straightforward. This 
         also makes it a useful teaching tool, helping new learners understand basic financial ideas. Another benefit is that it provides quick approximations, 
         allowing analysts to estimate the likelihood of price movements without needing complex models. Because of its smooth, symmetric shape.
      </p>
      <p>
         However, there are major drawbacks. Real stock market returns often show heavy tails, meaning extreme price jumps happen more often than a normal distribution
         predicts. This can lead to underestimating risk, especially during market crashes (COVID-19) or sudden events (TRUMP's TARRIFS) . The normal distribution also assumes symmetry, even though 
         real returns often show slight skewness. In addition, it assumes a constant variance, while market volatility frequently changes over time. For these reasons, 
         the normal distribution is useful as a baseline but not fully reliable for real-world prediction.
